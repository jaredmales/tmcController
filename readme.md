A c++ class to interface to Thorlabs Motion Control devices using libftdi1.

Note: this is only used by me for KPZ101 k-cubes, but it should be straightforward to extend for other devices.  PRs welcome.

See tmcController for a detailed description of the API.

See demo.cpp for an example of usage.
